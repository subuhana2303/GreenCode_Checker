Hi Replit team! 👋

Thanks for helping me start my Green Code Checker project — a sustainable Python analyzer built with Streamlit. The first part is working well! ✅

Now I’d like to move ahead with these additional advanced features to improve impact and make it more recruiter- and industry-friendly.

---

🌿 **Project Recap (for context):**
The app analyzes Python code, calculates a “Green Score” based on inefficient patterns, and offers sustainability-focused suggestions. It generates a downloadable .txt report and runs on Streamlit. The UI allows pasting or uploading code for analysis.

---

🧩 **Features Already Implemented:**
- Code analyzer using `ast`
- Detects:
  - while loops
  - unused imports
  - range(len()) anti-patterns
  - unused functions
- Green Score calculation (out of 100)
- Suggestions for cleaner code
- Downloadable sustainability report
- Streamlit interface with working logic

---

💡 **New Features I Want to Add (with your support):**

1. 📊 **Green Score Dashboard with Charts**
   - Add bar/pie chart to visualize code stats (loops, functions, etc.)
   - Use `matplotlib` or `plotly` inside Streamlit

2. 🧠 **AI-Powered Refactor Suggestions**
   - Button to generate cleaner code (via OpenAI or mock logic)
   - Return side-by-side original vs optimized version

3. 📈 **Green Score History Tracker**
   - Store previous scores in JSON or local file
   - Show line chart of improvements over time

4. 🧾 **Carbon Emission Estimator**
   - Estimate CO₂ saved by improving code
   - Based on static energy model (e.g., 1 loop ≈ X µJ = Y CO₂)

5. 🧬 **Code Complexity Metrics**
   - Cyclomatic complexity, nesting level, line count
   - Display as part of the report + UI

6. 🔐 **Security Pattern Detector**
   - Flag `eval()`, hardcoded credentials, insecure code

7. 🏅 **Gamification + Levels**
   - Show current user level (Green Beginner, Green Hero, etc.)
   - Suggest next step for leveling up

8. 💬 **LinkedIn Share Button + Public Badge**
   - Button to copy/share Green Score on LinkedIn
   - “Green Code Hero – Scored 92/100!” badge export

9. 🧪 **Code Test Bench (optional)**
   - If feasible in Replit sandbox, allow testing the input code
   - Output should show results and Green Score side by side

🙏 **What I need your help with:**
- Making sure these features are secure and performant on Replit
- Suggestions on best Replit structure for multi-file Streamlit app
- Persistent storage advice (for history tracking)
- How to make Streamlit dashboard interactive + visually appealing
- Tips to host and share a **public live link** on Replit
- Any known Replit constraints with `exec()` or `OpenAI` usage

This project will be published on GitHub + LinkedIn to attract recruiters and promote Green AI ideas. I’ll be crediting Replit for hosting it and sharing a working public demo link.

Thanks so much — excited to build this fully on Replit! 🌱💻
